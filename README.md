## Supabase Storage (manifest-first)

- Use a public Supabase bucket and the anon key (client-only).
- Layout: `{bucket}/collections/{collectionId}/manifest.json` plus `assets/*`.
- Connect with project URL, anon key, bucket name, collection id.
- Uploads/rescans are explicit; `manifest.json` stays the source of truth for cross-device loading.

## Usage

```
nix run
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`

Hint: VR Mode does only work via `https`.
